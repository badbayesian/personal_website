Hi, I’m Daniel Silva-Inclan. I am open to new opportunities in data science and data engineering.

These days, I work at EY, helping teams create AI and data systems that scale, from GenAI document-intelligence pipelines to ETL platforms on Databricks and Snowflake. My roots are in economics research: at the IMF and Becker Friedman Institute at UChicago where I built optimization frameworks and synthetic data tools that made economic modeling faster and more reliable.

Outside of work, you’ll find me tinkering with my home automation setup, self-hosting cloud services, experimenting with sous-vide + smoker recipes, or strategizing my next win in Age of Empires II: DE.
