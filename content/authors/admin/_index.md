Hello, my name is Daniel Silva-Inclan. I am actively seeking job opportunities in both software development and data science. 

I am interested in building robust software to scale better decision-making. In both my prior endeavors as a Research Assistant at UChicago and a Data Scientist at Civis Analytics, I built prototypes and visualizations of software solutions with domain experts and software engineers. I am most comfortable working in Python, R, bash, git, SQL, and Docker but also have experience with Go and C/C++. My preferred editor is Neovim + Terminator.

Outside of work, you can find me cooking new recipes (recently into replicating brown-sugar Boba ice cream) or playing Age of Empires 2.
