Hello, my name is Daniel Silva-Inclan. I am open to new opportunities in both software development and data science. 

I am interested in building robust software to better scale decision-making and research. In my 3+ years of experience, I have focused in leveraging computational tools to make the research process more efficient and robust. I have built and prototyped various software pipelines and visualizations for economists and other domain experts. I am most comfortable working in Python, R, bash, git, SQL, and Docker but also have experience with Go and C/C++. My preferred editor is Neovim + Terminator.

Outside of work, you can find me cooking new recipes (big fan of pambazos right now) or playing Age of Empires 2 DE.
