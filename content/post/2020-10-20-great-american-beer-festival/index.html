<p>With so many <code>beer categories</code> (448) there are only on average 11.1 beers in each category. With such a low sample size per <code>beer category</code>, the statistical power will be too low for most models especially time series or geospatial models which additionally reduce the sample size per bucket. As such, we can aggregate <code>beer category</code> to <code>beer style</code>, as defined by <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/styles/">Beer Advocate</a>, to created larger buckets and increase the sample size per bucket. Now, the larger set of beers has only 15 different buckets with on average 343.43 beers in each <code>beer style</code>. As we then cut on state (50+1) and time (1987 - 2020), we can be assured that enough data will be within most buckets so that the analysis has sufficient power.</p>

<p>One would imagine that different states may specialize in different categories or styles of beer. We can model this using <code>Log Odds</code> which creates a statistic of the strength of the relationship between two events. In our example, we might ask what beer categories are over/under represented in a given state. This may indicate a beverage specialization and perhaps a consumer preference for that state.</p>

<p>The analysis suggest that <code>beer categories</code>: Irish Dry and Imperial are more likely to come from California while Bock and (German/Bohemian) Pilseners are more likely to come from Colorado. Interestingly, some of the states have strong reversals in their log odds in comparison to other states suggesting states are specializing in thier beers.</p>
<p>We can also specifically look at <code>beer styles</code> to to check the robustness of the claim.</p>

<p>Aggregating the data still shows evidence of beer specialization per state. Some aspects if the specialization claim was over stated as the <code>Robust Porter</code> is over represented in California, however, <code>Porters</code> in general are not. Various specific categories of <code>Wheat Beers</code> are only vaguely over/under represented, however, the beer style of <code>Wheat Beers</code> are over represented in Colorado and under presented in California. Alternatively, in Texas, the <code>German Style Wheat Ale</code> is very over represented however, <code>Wheat Beers</code> in general are not. <code>Dark Lagers</code> beer style is very positive in Colorado and Texas and are very negative in California and Oregon. However, no specific category of <code>Dark Lagers</code> are particularly over/under representation.</p>
<p>We can also view this plot throughout the US as a proxy for specialization zones in the US.</p>
