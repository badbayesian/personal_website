<p>Most data scientists rely on out-of-the-box sampling methods such as optimizing with stochastic gradient descent or cross-validating their models. However, these naive sampling methods can sometimes lead data scientists astray with biased results. Luckily, with a little statistical theory and geometry, we can determine when to naively sample, and when we need to be a bit more clever.</p>

<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p>Suppose you’re an amateur climatologist who wants to determine if there is any new damage to the ozone layer. You can’t check every atmospheric point (satellite usage is expensive!) so you sample 1000 points on the Earth’s stratosphere. How should you pick those points?</p>

<p>To pick each point, we can use 3D spherical coordinates to ensure that each of the sampled points are on the surface of the sphere.</p>

<h3>Naive sampling</h3>
<p>Intuitively, one would think sampling uniformly on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> would result in the points being uniformly distributed on the sphere. Unfortunately, the points tend to cluster at the north and south poles <span class="math inline">\((z = \pm 1)\)</span>, creating a biased sample. You can interact with the plot below to better see the clustering at the poles.</p>

<p>To explain why we get these results, let’s look at a 2d circle. While the data is distributed uniformly between the angles <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, the space between each point is being stretched as the points move away from the center of the circle. The stretching generalizes to higher dimensions as shown previously with the clustering at the poles.</p>

<p>Mathematically, the proof of clustering at the poles on a sphere is shown by:
<span class="math display">\[ A = \int^{2\pi}_0 \int^{\pi}_0 sin\phi d\phi d\theta\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\implies dA = sin(\phi) d\phi d\theta\]</span>
The marginal area is a function of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> which implies that the area density of uniformly random points is not constant. Notice that the <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> in the marginal area equation is minimized at <span class="math inline">\(\phi = \{0, \pi\}\)</span>. In Cartesian coordinates, that corresponds to the North and South poles, respectively (<span class="math inline">\(z \pm 1\)</span>). The marginal area will hence correspondingly get smaller at the two poles. Therefore, if points are uniformly sampled in each marginal area, the poles are more area-dense as compared to points sampled from the equator. To achieve uniform samples throughout the sphere, we need our sampling method to incorporate how the marginal area changes along the surface area.</p>

<h3>Sampling with theory</h3>
<p>So how do we de-bias the sample? While there are many different ways to correctly sample, I will use <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\textbf{inverse transform sampling}}\)</span> only because in this example we can derive the CDF and each sample is expensive to obtain. In other conditions, rejection sampling methods such as MCMC may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>We first need to find a suitable pdf. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is a point on the sphere <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. We need to construct a pdf such that the probability density is constant throughout the sphere. We can use a couple facts about probability and the sphere’s geometry to find <span class="math inline">\(f(v)\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Points can only be sampled on the surface of the sphere.
<span class="math display">\[\int\int_S f(v) dA = 1\]</span></li>
<li>The surface area of the sphere is:
<span class="math display">\[\int\int_S dA = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} sin(d\phi) d\phi d\theta = 4 \pi\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Hence,
<span class="math display">\[f(v)dA = f(\theta, \phi) d\theta d\phi \implies f(\theta, \phi) = \frac{1}{4\pi}sin(\phi)\]</span>
We can find the marginal distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> from the joint distribution by:
<span class="math display">\[f(\theta) = \int_0^\pi \frac{1}{4\pi}sin(\phi) d\phi = \frac{1}{2\pi}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\phi) = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{4\pi}sin(\phi) d\theta = \frac{sin(\phi)}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the first equation is already a constant so we don’t need to transform it. The second equation is a function of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> and requires a transformation. Remember that <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> refers to the polar angle where <span class="math inline">\(\phi = 0, \pi\)</span> point to the poles <span class="math inline">\(z \pm 1\)</span>. Hence, we only need to adjust how we sample <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to correct the bias.</p>
<p>We can now use inverse transform sampling. The first step is to find the CDF of <span class="math inline">\(f(\phi)\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[F(\phi_0) = \int_0^{\phi_0} \frac{sin(\phi)}{2} d\phi = \frac{1}{2}(1 - cos(\phi_0)) \]</span>
Then, we find the inverse of the CDF:
<span class="math display">\[F^{-1}(u) = arccos(1 - 2u) \]</span>
Lastly, we uniformly sample <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and transform it based on the inverse CDF above:
<span class="math display">\[U \sim unif(0,1)\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[X \sim arccos(1 - 2U)\]</span>
The transformed distribution <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> will conform to the wanted pdf <span class="math inline">\(f(\phi)\)</span>.</p>
